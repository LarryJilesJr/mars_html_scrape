# mars_html_scrape

This project focuses on analyzing weather data collected from the Mars Curiosity rover. 
The data includes information about temperature, pressure, and other atmospheric conditions recorded on the Martian surface.

I was able to conduct the analysis using Python programming language and various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and BeautifulSoup. The data is obtained from online sources and stored in a Pandas DataFrame for further processing and visualization.

Project Structure -->
Data Collection: Web scraping techniques are used to gather weather data from online sources.
Data Cleaning: The collected data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove any inconsistencies or missing values.
Data Analysis: Various statistical analyses and visualizations are performed to gain insights into Martian weather patterns.
Results Interpretation: The findings are interpreted and presented in a clear and understandable manner.

The dependencies I used:
Python 3.x
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
BeautifulSoup
